# Buffer Overflow Vulnerability Exploitation

This repository contains a simple Python script (`badfile_generator.py`) that generates a payload for exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability. The payload includes NOP sleds and a shellcode to demonstrate the basic concept of a stack-based buffer overflow.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

## Usage

To generate the payload and run the Docker container, follow these steps:

```bash
bash run.sh
```
